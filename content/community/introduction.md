Self-hosted, semi-public digital infrastructure providing community services to Remilia Collective and Remilia friends & family.

Social:

Remilia Community - Structured IRC - Slack-like Zulip with mailing-list like conversation threading. Will replace the Discord. Plan to eventually replace with Matrix as a more lindy federated option, once the infra is ready.
Remilia.wired - Unstructured rtIRC - realtime IRC server. Any user can start up their own chat on the host.
Media:

Remilia Records - Shared Music Library - Essentially a collaborative iTunes library where users can all upload their music and stream it freely. Accomplished through "Funkwhale", a federated application. Only Remilia Collective members will have rights to upload music.
Remilia Bookshelf - Shared PDF Library - A curated selection of PDFs for view/download. Accomplished through Calibre-web.
Remilia Archive - self-hosted wayback machine, via archivematica

The importance of Remilia-hosted services will become more evident as global instability increasingly descends onto our world and threatens our basic digital infrastructure.
