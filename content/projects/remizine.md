## RemiZine

The RemiZine will be a quarterly [electronic zine](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Ezine) collaborated on by Remilia Collective artists, as an outlet for experimental work and platform for collective collaboration. Issues will be provided exclusively to shareholders.

Each RemiZine issue will have a specific theme with unique art and writing contributed to it, and be presented in the format of a 3D render of a traditional double-binded magazine.

Issues of RemiZine will be airdropped directly to all Remi Shareholder wallets, providing an effective and elegant distribution platform, and allowing each issue to accrue in value as collectable items with exclusive artist content.

As far as we are aware, RemiZine is the first NFT zine.
