## Remilia Shares Token (RST)
Holding RST provides NFT drops from Remilia Collective artists/collabs. Some are rare lotteries to RST holders (eg to 2% of RST), some go 1 to every RST. In both cases, holding more RST results in more value distribution in NFTs
Hard to predict value of the RST as it depends on the value of the NFTs provided
Imagine a RemCo artist gets known and begins regularly selling NFTs for ~$30K. He does an NFT release of only 100 copies (say, 100/1500 existing RST), how much would it go for on the NFT market? What does that make an RST worth if it’s only a random chance, but it’s something that can happen throughout the year as well? What will that NFT be worth in 1 year?
