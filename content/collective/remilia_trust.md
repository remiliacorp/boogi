Title: "The Remilia Trust"
order: 4
---

The Remilia Trust will be initiated once the Remilia Co-op's fund hits a target number, at which point the Co-op fund will be re-organized into a series of equal, individual trusts for each member paying out interest monthly until death.

The Remilia Trust's target goal is to provide an ample salary (say, $100K annual) for every member of the Collective, maintained into perpetuity by investing into a conservative index fund and paying out interest (after a portion reinvested to meet inflation).

*Note: If we have 10 members, we need about $1.3MM each, $13MM total, to achieve $100K annual each off interest; at 20% Co-Op contribution, that's $60MM total sales. Can we do it? I think so, if we can expect ETH to 4X in next 3 years, and sell pieces for an average of $10,000 ea. At ten members, we would need to do a total of 150 sales each, or ~4 sales per month each for 3 years, to hit $60MM.*
