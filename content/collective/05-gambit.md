Title: "NFT and the Art World Gambit"
Order: 5
---

Remilia is forming an art collective to force self-legitimization of contemporary digital art through the NFT ("non-fungible token") cryptoart world, an immature market we could easily move in on and establish a position for us that will force recognition when the IRL art world eventually follows.

The NFT market has its own burgeoning art world, but it's a virgin field. I believe we can move in on the market as a collective & dominate it with our new mode of works.

This is a unique opportunity to force open the door our online practices to be recognized as art, as it really is, train the market to see it, to consume it as such, and allow us to be appropriately compensated. When the real art world eventually moves onto NFT, as it inevitably will, they'll be forced to grapple with it.
