We're on the cusp of the new mode; posting is the work -- When you post, your enter a lucid, ascetic state, a communion with the network. It's not just media produced in the dark room alone, one picture a day for a 100 days. A video worked on for a week, and uploaded modestly to your page, then linked desperately to anyone you meet. No, it's networked. Authorship died by being distributed.

Commodifiability of art isn't important for the cash, but the legitimacy the market provides it, enabling its appreciation and consumption. NFT widens the range of sellable "mediums" to the most abstracted possible. We will teach them to appreciate our body of works, as they are. The money is just a proxy for reach & appreciation.

How the real art world is, its stratified, institutional, bureacratic, careful and conservative -- they've lost relevance in commentary for the contemporary and no longer exist in a position as the upstream of culture; the digital world is lost to them even as it takes over the real. This generation is experiencing a huge abundance of online artists -- true artists, who live every aspect of their lives as art -- at the same time that they are completely demoralized from actually producing in any frame compatible with the art world; but they do make it, every day, in everything they do. The art world market (and its almost total death of critics) just has fallen too far behind to understand it and recognize it as such.

But NFT is inevitable to be adopted by the art world due to it fixing real issues of provenance, so the NFT art world and irl art world will quickly get integrated. All goal in moving onto the NFT space is to sidestep the irl art world and use the openness of the NFT art world to introduce this new art, so when the integration happens, we're sitting on a well-established model that can be accepted as the new form. That's the Remilia gambit. Remilia is reclaiming what's ours.
