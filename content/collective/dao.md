Remilia Collective is organized as an invite-only selection of artists participating pseudonymously in the NFT space under the careful curation and direction of Remilia Corp. Artists are chosen for exploring new modes of art making influenced by the internet experience and its culture, 

Each artist commits to selling NFT art exclusively through Remilia’s custom-built NFT gallery as part of the basic contract retaining Remilia Corp as their agent.

## Co-op DAO

Artists joining the primary Remilia Collective commit to a more elaborate contract structured as a co-operative investment fund. A flat portion of proceeds from each sale are redistributed into a group investment fund through a smart contract, with the earnings shared quarterly between all artists. This is structured in such a way to foster a spirit of collaboration.
