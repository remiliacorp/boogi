title: "Remilia Gallery"
order: 1

We will of course eventually design a virtual 3D gallery curated into proper shows. It is inevitable.

It'll be done in Unreal Engine because it has great light rendering as well as already integrated VR support. It will be a multiplayer server with text chat and voice chat with direct links to purchase the art via crypto.

We need not only represent RemCo artists, but we'll be selling all art we show on similar commission. The artists do not have any freedom to mess with the meta of the gallery - only 2D images, 3D sculptures, or installations will be allowed. It will be browser based and also uploaded to VR app stores.
