Title: Patron Fund
Order: 3

In the spirit of collaboration, Remilia Corp will institute a Patron Fund from a portion of the revenue generated by Remilia Market sales. This will be used towards offering Remilia Grants and supporting Remilia Residencies.

Grant nominees will be determined by Remilia Corp curation on a monthly basis with winners voted on by shareholders using their Patron Fund Votes. 

<tip>Patron votes are not one per individual; higher tier shareholders hold more votes than lower tier shareholders.</tip>

Shareholders can also vote for their favorite RemCo artist of the month. The artist will earn 1 Remilia Star which will be displayed on their artist page. 3 Stars are exchangeable for a Jade Cabbage from Remilia Treasury's private storage.
