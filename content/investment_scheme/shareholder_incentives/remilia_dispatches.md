Title: Dispatches
Order: 2
---

Dispatches are any NFT communications distributed to every Remilia Shareholder. Note that unlike [Art Drops](art_drops), holding more shares will not entitle a shareholder to more copies of any given dispatch - only one dispatch is provided to each walley that contains at least on or more Remilia Share.

## Dispatch Design

Dispatches are provided as highly diluted NFTs as an experiment in utilizing NFT air drops as a distribution platform. The format is open-ended, but examples include a simple letter intended to be read by all shareholders, to an art print, to the [RemiZine](../../projects/remizine).

## Speculative Value

All Dispatches will be unique and minted only once, so it is plausible some Dispatches may achieve a high resale value in the collector's market, especially earlier Dispatches while the Remilia Share supply is low, and unique artist prints or [RemiZine](../../projects/remizine) issues, however speculative value is not a primary concern in Dispatch production as it is for [Art Drops](art_drops).
