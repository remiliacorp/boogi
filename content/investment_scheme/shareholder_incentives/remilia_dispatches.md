Title: Dispatches
Order: 2

Dispatches are any communications distributed to every Remilia Shareholder - defined as any wallet which contains one or more Remilia Share. Unlike Art Drops, holding more shares will not entitle a shareholder to more copies of any given dispatch.

Dispatches are provided as NFTs as an experiment in utilizing air drops as a distribution platform. The form is open-ended, but examples include a simple letter intended to be read by all shareholders, a highly diluted art print, and the RemiZine.

## RemiZine

The RemiZine will be a quarterly [electronic zine](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Ezine) collaborated on by Remilia Collective artists, as an outlet for experimental work and platform for collective collaboration. As far as we are aware, is the first NFT zine. Issues will be provided exclusively to shareholders.
